# Celestial-Bot
<br>
<h3> About </h3>
<p> A project I started working on in mid-2020, using the Discord API. It was launched publicly for a short while but the project eventually died as I had no time to maintain or run it. 
The bot had undergone close to 2 re-writes and multiple patches. It uses discord.js v12 and required node.js to run. This is the third and final re-write of the bot <b> which was abandoned halfway </b>, due to the same reason stated above and the unreal number of changes the library brought every year. 
<br> 
The code has just been laying here in a private repository for close to a year, so I decided to make it public. A major portion of the bot is done and tested.
<br>
<h3> Development </h3> 
I have no plans to continue working on this project anytime in the near future. Although since this was one of the very first things I made using JavaScript, it will always be a special project for me. 
<br> 
<h3> Self-Hosting </h3> 
If you want to self host it, feel free to. However, please note that <b>some commands of the bot may be incomplete or buggy.</b> Please provide the required credits if you wish to further work on it and launch it publicly.
